// You are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from lowLimit up to highLimit inclusive (i.e., n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.
// Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number 321 will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.
// Given two integers lowLimit and highLimit, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.
