// There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.
// It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].
// You are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].
// Return the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.
