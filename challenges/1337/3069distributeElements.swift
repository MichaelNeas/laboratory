You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.

You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:

/// If the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2, append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.
/// The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
/// Return the array result.


class Solution {
    func resultArray(_ nums: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        var arr1 = [nums[0]]
        var arr2 = [nums[1]]

        for i in 2..<nums.count {
            if arr1.last! > arr2.last! {
                arr1.append(nums[i])
            } else {
                arr2.append(nums[i])
            }
        }

        return arr1 + arr2
    }
}
